                    <p style="text-align: justify">The data produced and published by Rice database is governed by the following data policy. Our mission is to support open data and information sharing. We also recognize the need for limited and time-sensitive protection of certain types of data to support the use of such data by those who generate it.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">For sequencing projects: Data are subject to a one-year embargo. For each data or analytical product (raw or processed), the embargo begins upon completion of the standard deliverables as described in the catalog. At the end of the embargo period, the data will be publicly available on the relevant Rice database portal and will not be subject to use restrictions.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Rice database is keen to see the data generated by the facility lead to scientific publications. Rice database users and collaborators have the right to produce publication manuscripts and the responsibility to lead this effort, and Rice database would like to receive confirmation (see sponsorship statement below) of the sequence data generated as well as any other contributions such as assembly, analysis, annotation, validation, creation of genome browsers, etc.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Users, collaborators, and Rice database are jointly committed to publishing the first analysis of data generated by this facility, provided it is done in a timely manner. Publications resulting from these efforts should specify the collaborative nature of the project, and it is expected that authorship should include all those who have contributed significantly to the work.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">Rice database has extensive experience and capabilities in the analysis, annotation, comparative analysis and interpretation of sequence and functional genomics data types, as well as advanced assembly and engineering strategies for DNA synthesis applications. If Rice database personnel have made significant contributions to data generation and analysis or DNA synthesis and engineering efforts in a manner that goes beyond the deliverables of Rice database standard products and/or have made substantial intellectual contributions to the production of the manuscript, it is best practice to include these individuals as authors of the publication. Attribution arrangements should reflect the respective contributions of collaborators and users. For example, if JGI staff played a lead role in the analysis, planning, writing, and editing of the manuscript under an agreement with the collaborator, it is desirable that these individuals appear as first and/or senior authors of the paper.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">To ensure the security and reliability of user data submission and storage processes, the following measures can be taken:</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">1. Data Encryption.</p>
                    <p> - Use the HTTPS protocol during data transmission to ensure that data is not intercepted or tampered with during transit.</p>
                    <p> - Encrypt data stored on the server to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">2. Data Backup and Recovery.</p>
                    <p> - Perform regular data backups to ensure quick recovery in case of data loss or damage.</p>
                    <p> - Test data recovery processes to ensure the integrity and availability of backup data.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">3. Logging and Monitoring.</p>
                    <p> - Implement detailed logging to record all data access and operation activities.</p>
                    <p> - Monitor for abnormal activities and promptly respond to potential security threats.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify">4. Regular Security Audits and Testing.</p>
                    <p> - Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans to identify and fix potential security weaknesses.</p>
                    <p> - Perform penetration testing to simulate attacker behavior and detect system vulnerabilities.</p>
